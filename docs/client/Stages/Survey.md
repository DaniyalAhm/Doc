## Component Structure

The `MyPlayerForm` component renders an input form where players can enter their player identifier. The form includes a description about the research project and a `Next` button to submit the ID. The input field is disabled when the `connecting` prop is true.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

export function MyPlayerForm({ onPlayerID, connecting }) {
  const [playerID, setPlayerID] = useState("");

  const handleSubmit = (evt) => {
    evt.preventDefault();
    if (!playerID || playerID.trim() === "") {
      return;
    }

    onPlayerID(playerID);
  };

  return (
    <div id="intro-container" className="h-svh flex flex-col justify-center items-center">
      <div id="intro-card-container" className="card rounded-3xl flex flex-col p-8 justify-items-center w-[22rem] h-[38rem] desktop:h-[34rem] desktop:w-maxintroCardW tablet:h-[34rem] tablet:w-maxintroCardW tablet:p-10 m-12">
        <div className="text-center">
          <p className="text-lg tablet:text-3xl text-blue-600 mb-4 tablet:mb-6"> H2H Market</p>
          <span className="text-[0.5rem] tablet:text-[0.6rem]">

          </span>
          <p className="text-xs pt-3 tablet:text-base tablet:pt-5">Enter your Player Identifier:</p>
          <form action="#" method="POST" onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
            <fieldset disabled={connecting}>
              <input
                type="text"
                id="player-identifier-box"
                placeholder="abc..."
                autoComplete="off"
                autoFocus
                required
                value={playerID}
                onChange={(e) => setPlayerID(e.target.value)}
                className="text-center my-6 text-xs text-gray-600 rounded-2xl bg-white border-2 border-gray-600 p-4 w-full xs:w-auto xs:flex-grow"
              />
              <div>
                <button id="nextBtn" type="submit" className="nextBtn rounded-2xl bg-blue-600 text-white text-lg py-2 px-5 text-sellerTxt">
                  Next {">"}
                </button>
              </div>
            </fieldset>
          </form>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Props

The `MyPlayerForm` component accepts the following props:

- **`onPlayerID`**: A function passed as a prop that handles the player ID submission.
- **`connecting`**: A boolean that disables the form when set to `true`.

---

## Functions

### `handleSubmit`

```js
const handleSubmit = (evt) => {
  evt.preventDefault();
  if (!playerID || playerID.trim() === "") {
    return;
  }

  onPlayerID(playerID);
};
```

- **Description**: Prevents the default form submission behavior and triggers the `onPlayerID` function with the entered `playerID` if the input is valid.
- **Returns**: `void`

---

## State

- **`playerID`**: A state variable that stores the player identifier entered by the user.

---

## Styling

- **Tailwind CSS** is used for layout and design.
- The component uses responsive classes such as `h-svh`, `w-[22rem]`, `text-xs`, and `tablet:text-3xl`.
- **Form Styling**:
  - The input box is styled with classes like `text-center`, `rounded-2xl`, `bg-white`, `border-gray-600`, and `p-4`.
  - The submit button is styled with `bg-blue-600`, `text-white`, `rounded-2xl`, and `text-lg`.
  
```html
<input
  className="text-center my-6 text-xs text-gray-600 rounded-2xl bg-white border-2 border-gray-600 p-4 w-full"
/>
<button
  className="nextBtn rounded-2xl bg-blue-600 text-white text-lg py-2 px-5 text-sellerTxt"
>
  Next {">"}
</button>
```

## Additional Information

- The form will be disabled when `connecting` is `true`, ensuring that users cannot interact with it while the connection is being processed.
- The form includes a brief description about the MIT research project and the purpose of the survey.
